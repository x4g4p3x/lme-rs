# Changelog

## [0.2.7] - 2024-12-19

### ✨ Added

- **Multi-way Interaction Support**: Complete implementation of multi-way interactions (e.g., `x1*x2*x3`) with canonical expansion
- **InteractionTerm Role**: Added new `InteractionTerm` role to `VariableRole` enum for interaction variables
- **Comprehensive Interaction Metadata**: Each variable now includes detailed interaction information showing all interactions it participates in
- **Canonical Expansion**: Multi-way interactions now generate all possible combinations (2-way, 3-way, etc.) as per R/Wilkinson notation standards
- **Test Example**: Added `test_multiway_interaction.rs` example demonstrating 2-way, 3-way, and 4-way interactions
- **Categorical Function Support**: Added `c()` function for categorical variables with reference level specification
- **Named Arguments**: Added support for named arguments in function calls (e.g., `ref=treatment`)
- **Categorical Role**: Added new `Categorical` role to `VariableRole` enum for categorical variables
- **Test Example**: Added `test_categorical_function.rs` example demonstrating categorical function usage

### 🔧 Improved

- **Interaction Parsing**: Completely rewritten `push_interaction` method to handle nested interaction structures
- **Variable Extraction**: New `extract_all_variables` method recursively extracts all variables from nested interactions
- **Combination Generation**: New helper methods to generate all possible interaction combinations
- **Interaction Naming**: Interaction variables now use underscore-separated naming (e.g., `x1_x2_x3`)

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Multi-way Interaction Bug**: Fixed issue where `x1*x2*x3` was only generating 2-way interactions instead of the complete canonical expansion
- **Missing Higher-order Interactions**: Resolved problem where 3-way and higher-order interactions were not being generated

### 📝 Technical Details

- **Canonical Expansion**: For `x1*x2*x3`, now generates: `[x1, x2, x3, x1_x2, x1_x3, x2_x3, x1_x2_x3]`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing 2-way interactions continue to work as before
- **Role Assignment**: Interaction variables receive both `InteractionTerm` and `FixedEffect` roles
- **Metadata Structure**: Each variable includes comprehensive interaction metadata with order, context, and participating variables

## [0.2.5] - 2024-12-19

### ✨ Added

- **Identity Role for Plain Terms**: Added new `Identity` role to `VariableRole` enum for variables that appear as plain terms in formulas (e.g., `x` in `y ~ x`)
- **Intercept Column Support**: Added automatic inclusion of `"intercept"` column in `all_generated_columns` when `has_intercept` is true
- **Formula Order Mapping**: Added new `all_generated_columns_formula_order` field that maps formula order (1, 2, 3...) to column names
- **Intercept-Only Model Support**: Added support for intercept-only models like `y ~ 1` and no-intercept models like `y ~ 0` with new `Term::Intercept` and `Term::Zero` variants
- **Multivariate Model Support**: Added support for multivariate response models like `bind(y1, y2) ~ x` with new `Response::Multivariate` variant and `bind()` function parsing
- **Tests**: Added 11 new unit tests to verify intercept handling, formula order mapping, intercept-only model functionality, and multivariate model support

### 🔧 Improved

- **Variable Role Assignment**: Plain terms now correctly receive `Identity` role instead of `FixedEffect` role
- **Generated Columns Preservation**: Variables with `Identity` role now preserve their original column name in generated columns list
- **Intercept Positioning**: Intercept column is automatically inserted at index 1 (after response variable) in `all_generated_columns`

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Issue #1**: Fixed intercept-only model parsing by adding support for `y ~ 1` and `y ~ 0` formulas
- **Issue #3**: Added multivariate model support with `bind()` function for multiple response variables
- **Issue #4**: Fixed plain terms not receiving proper `Identity` role when appearing alone in formulas
- **Issue #6**: Fixed missing intercept column in `all_generated_columns` and added formula order mapping

### 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test coverage for intercept, formula order, and intercept-only model functionality
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure intercept is present when `has_intercept` is true and absent when false
- **Order Validation**: Tests verify correct column ordering in both `all_generated_columns` and `all_generated_columns_formula_order`
- **Intercept-Only Models**: Tests verify `y ~ 1` and `y ~ 0` formulas work correctly with proper metadata generation
- **Multivariate Models**: Tests verify `bind(y1, y2) ~ x` formulas work correctly with multiple response variables
- **Error Handling**: Tests verify invalid syntax like `y ~ 1 - 1` and `y ~ 0 + 1` fails appropriately

### 🔄 Internal Changes

- **AST Enhancement**: Added new `Term::Intercept`, `Term::Zero` variants and `Response::Multivariate` enum to support intercept-only, no-intercept, and multivariate models
- **Parser Updates**: Enhanced `parse_term()` to recognize `Token::One` and `Token::Zero` as valid terms, and `parse_response()` to handle `bind()` function calls
- **Syntax Validation**: Added validation to prevent contradictory syntax like `y ~ 1 - 1` and invalid combinations like `y ~ 0 + 1`
- **MetaBuilder Enhancement**: Updated `build()` method to handle intercept insertion and formula order mapping, and `push_response()` to handle multivariate responses
- **Data Structure Updates**: Enhanced `FormulaMetaData` struct with new `all_generated_columns_formula_order` field
- **Role Management**: Improved role assignment logic in `push_plain_term()` and `add_transformation()` methods

## [0.2.4] - 2025-09-05

### Added

## [0.2.3] - 2025-09-05

### ✨ Added

- **Code Style**: Eliminated clippy warnings throughout the codebase
  - Removed unnecessary `to_string()` calls in format strings
  - Converted instance methods to static methods where appropriate
  - Removed unnecessary return statements

### 🧹 Code Quality

- **Dead Code**: Eliminated all dead code warnings in main library
- **Clippy Compliance**: Achieved zero clippy warnings for main library code
- **Performance**: Optimized error formatting to avoid unnecessary string allocations

### 🔄 Internal Changes

- **Error Processing**: Streamlined error handling pipeline to preserve original `ParseError::Unexpected` for better formatting
- **String Processing**: Improved error message generation to be more efficient and readable

#### Example Output Format:
```
Syntax error- Unexpected Token
Formula: y ~ x +
Show: y ~ x + <eoi>
Expected Token: Function or ColumnName
```

These changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the developer experience when working with formula parsing errors.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-09-05

added `lex_formula` for users to inspect raw lexer output

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-04

just to trigger a new release

## [0.2.2] - 2025-09-05

### Added

- Multiplication/interaction parsing: Support for `*` (full interaction) in formulas was added so expressions like `wt*hp` are parsed correctly and represented as interaction terms in the AST and metadata output.

### Changed

- Parser internals: Improved term parsing and interaction handling to correctly parse chained interactions (`a*b*c`) and mixed interaction operators (`:` and `*`). The implementation centralises interaction handling to avoid double-consuming tokens and to make chaining robust.

- Files changed:
  - `src/internal/parse_term.rs` — refactored and documented to parse atomic terms (columns/functions), then build interaction chains by consuming `:` and `*` tokens and constructing `Term::Interaction` nodes.
  - `src/internal/parse_rhs.rs` — adjusted plus-separated term handling to avoid double token consumption when iterating `+`-separated terms.

### Added (debug)

- Temporary example `examples/print_tokens.rs` used to inspect lexer output while debugging interaction token ordering. This can be removed after verification.

### Notes

- The changes include extra inline documentation in the modified files. I ran the `examples/mtcars` example to validate behavior and confirmed the output now includes the `wt*hp` interaction and correct generated columns from `poly(disp, 4)`.
